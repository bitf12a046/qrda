intro.title.intro=QRDA SCHEMATRON VALIDATOR
intro.text=<b>The Quality Reporting Document Architecture (QRDA)</b> is a document template for reporting eCQMs to CMS. \
It is a type of Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) which specifies the format and language of clinical documents.\
 QRDA is split into two categories, QRDA-I and QRDA-III which are differentiated by the type of data they are reporting. \
 <p><b>QRDA-I:</b> Collects quality data for an individual patient for one or more quality measures. When pooled and analyzed, each \
 report contributes the quality data necessary to calculate population measure metrics.</p>\
<p><b>QRDA-III:</b> Aggregate quality reporting containing calculated summary data for one or more measures for a specified population \
of patients within a particular health system over a specific period of time. </p> \
 <p>A document written in the QRDA format will contain all the information necessary to fulfill reporting requirements for CMS reimbursement.</p> 
 
 intro.descriptions.intro=The <b>QRDA Schematron Validator</b> tool allows you to run validations of test report files against schematrons built for those specific report types. \
 This can be useful in the development of a schematron: use this tool to verify that the schematron is reporting failures in test files with known errors. \
 It is also useful for validating test files against a schematron known to be correctly defined.</p> \
 <p>There are three workspaces in this tool, each accessible by selecting the tabs along the top of the tool window. <br/></p>
 
 # Home page: Schematron information
 
 introMenuSchematrons=Schematron Inventory
 intro.title.schematrons=SCHEMATRON INVENTORY
 intro.descriptions.schematrons= <p>The Schematron Inventory is accessed via the Schematron tab in the top menu. The schematron inventory allows you to \
 view, upload and remove schematron files used in the tool to validate report files. This tool allows for the management of four types \
 of schematron files. Each type allows for the validation of different classes of report files. The four schematron types validate the following report types: \
 <ul><li>Hospital Quality Reports (HQR)</li><li>Clinical Exchange Center QRDA Reports (CEC)</li><li>Health Level 7 Reports (HL7)</li><li>Physicians Quality Reporting System Reports (PQRS)</li></ul> </p>\
 <p>The schematrons available for use in validating the above types of report files are displayed according to the type of report they validate. When you upload \
 a new schematron file into the system, care must be taken to upload the schematron in the appropriate section of the inventory. </p>\
 <p>Note that the ability exists to remove a schematron from this tool. Use discretion before removing a schematron as these are available to all users of the tool.

# Home page: Test File information

introMenuTestFiles=Test File Inventory
intro.title.testfiles=TEST FILE INVENTORY
intro.descriptions.testfiles=<p>The test report files available for validation using the schematrons in the tool are managed by selecting \
the Test Files menu item in the top menu. The structure of the test file inventory mirrors exactly the structure of the schematron inventory: the test files are segregated \
according to their report type - one of HQR, CEC, HL7, or PQRS as described in the Schematron Inventory description..</p>\
<p>Like schematron files, you can upload test files into the tool. You must upload a test file into the tool in the Test File Inventory before you can validate that\
 file against a schematron. A test file should be a well-formed XML file in order for the validation to work appropriately.</p>\
<p>When a test file is validated against a schematron in this tool, the number of error and warning failures are calculated and presented in the results. You can\
 indicate the number of errors and/or warnings expected in the validation by providing that information in the header comments section of your test file. Place the following\
 comment lines within the first 20 lines of your test file to have those values tracked: </p> \
<p style="text-align:center;">Total Errors Expected: N<br/>\
                              Total Warnings Expected: N</p>\
<p> where N is the actual failure count you expect in the test.<br/>Note:These lines are optional. They are not required to run the validation process.</p>\
<p>As with schematron files, the ability exists to remove test files from this tool. Use discretion before removing a test file, especially one you did not upload yourself, as these are available to all users of the tool.<\p>

# Home page:  Workbench information

introMenuWorkbench=Validation Workbench
intro.title.workbench=VALIDATION WORKBENCH
intro.descriptions.workbench=<p>Select the Workbench menu item to validate test files using a schematron suitable for particular files you have chosen. </p> \
In this tool you create a Validation Suite, which consists of a schematron file and a list of test files to validate using that schematron. When the test files \
in a validation suite are validated using the schematron, the results of the validation run are displayed in the workbench. Select a test file validation report to view \
the details of the test results for that file.</p> \
<p>Note: The schematron file and the test files must be present in the schematron and test file inventories, respectively, \
in order to be available for use in a Validation Suite.</p>\
Further detailed instructions on creating and running a validation suite are presented when you navigate to the Validation Workbench.<\p>

# Home page: Developer technical notes

introMenuTechNotes=Technical Notes
intro.title.technotes=Technical Notes
intro.descriptions.technotes=<p>This tool was developed as a web application. It was developed, tested, and deployed to run in an Apache Tomcat Web Server. </p>\
<p>All files uploaded and generated by this tool are stored on disc in a filespace defined by the environment variable QRDA_HOME.  They are NOT stored within the application context of the tool's .war or expanded .war filespace. \
The filespace in which the files are kept, i.e. the tool's file repository, is a fixed set of file folders located immediately under the folder defined in the system environment varialble QRDA_HOME. The QRDA_HOME environment \
variable is defined in /etc/init/tomcat.conf in a Linux environment, or as a system environment variable in a Windows environment. \
  (You can also set the QRDA_HOME environment variable in setenv.sh file in the CATALINA_HOME/bin directory in Linux). <br/>The QRDA_HOME \
folder structure is: \
			<ul style='list-style:none;'><li>&lsaquo;QRDA_HOME&rsaquo; <ul style='list-style:none;'><li>qrda\
			<ul style='list-style:none;'><li>isoFiles</li><li>properties</li><li>schematrons\
			                                                    <ul style='list-style:none;'><li>HL7</li><li>CEC</li><li>HQR</li><li>PQRS</li></ul> \
			                                              </li><li>testfiles\
			                                                    <ul style='list-style:none;'><li>HL7</li><li>CEC</li><li>HQR</li><li>PQRS</li></ul>\
			                                              </li><li>result</li>\
			</ul></li></ul></li></ul>\
<p>The <i>properties</i> folder, above, contains a properties file  <i>validator.properties</i>. This file contains the names of the ISO transformation files that the tool uses in transforming a schematron file into an .xsl file that is used to validate test files.\
The actual ISO files referenced in the <i>validator.properties</i> file are stored in the <i>isoFiles</i> folder in the filespace as defined above. </p>\
<p>The <i>result</i> folder contains the files generated by the tool when validating test files against a schematron. A new folder under the <i>result</i> folder is created for \
each validation suite created and run in the Validation workbench.</p>\
<p>For this tool to run properly, two files must be present in the QRDA_HOME/isoFiles directory: \
<ul><li><b>voc.xml</b>: a file that defines a vocabulary namespace. A copy of this vocabulary file appropriate for  this tool must be located in the <i>isoFiles</i> folder. \
<\li><li><b>iso_schematron_skeleton_for_saxon.xsl</b>: an XSL file necessary for transforming schematron files. A copy of this file must be located in the <i>isoFiles</i> folder.  \
</li></ul> </p><p>If deployed on a Linux-based server, the permissions for QRDA_HOME file space must be set properly to allow for the creating, reading, and writing of files and folders. \
<p>When viewing and validating very large files, there is a chance that the Apache Tomcat application will run out of memory to perform properly. As a precaution, a system \
administrator may increase the allotted memory available to the Tomcat application. Set a system environment variabe CATALINA_OPTS to the value below: <\p> \
<p style='text-align:center;'>-Xms512m -Xmx1024m</p><p>to increase Tomcat memory allocations. (The server musts be restarted for the change to take effect.)</p>
